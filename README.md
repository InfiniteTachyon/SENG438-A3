# 1 Introduction

The focus of this assignment is similar to the previous one, as it involves unit testing using JUnit in Eclipse. Students will begin by getting familiar with the testing tools before proceeding with the implementation (enhancement) of the test suite. However, this assignment differs from the previous Ass2 in that it introduces students to a new technique for deciding which test cases to develop: white-box coverage criteria.

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 3 Description of the testing strategy for the new unit tests
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 4 Description of five selected test cases, and how they have increased code coverage
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5 Report of the coverage achieved of each class and method
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6 Pros and cons of the coverage tools tried by your group in this assignment
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 7 Comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 8 How the team work/effort was divided and managed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 9 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the assignment
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 10 Comments/feedback on the assignment itself
