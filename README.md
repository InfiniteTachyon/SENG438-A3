# 1 Introduction

The focus of this assignment is similar to the previous one, as it involves unit testing using JUnit in Eclipse. Students will begin by getting familiar with the testing tools before proceeding with the implementation (enhancement) of the test suite. However, this assignment differs from the previous Ass2 in that it introduces us to a new technique for deciding which test cases to develop: white-box coverage criteria.

In this lab, we will expan our unit test suite based on the previous lab. The test will also be developed based on white-box criteria, specifically in statement, branch and method coverage. This lab aim to create serveral more detailed test that fit in high percentage coverage criteria.

# 8 Dscussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the assignment
When we worked together, we realized that it could be challenging to coordinate schedules and ensure that everyone is working on the same page. Also, we found that Writing practical JUnit tests with a clear understanding of the codebase can be more accessible, which may lead to ineffective tests or false positives. On the other hand, we can overcome coordination issues by maintaining open communication channels and regularly checking in on each other's progress. Additionally, Writing practical JUnit tests is crucial for ensuring software quality and detecting defects early in the development process, and it helps us better understand this knowledge.
