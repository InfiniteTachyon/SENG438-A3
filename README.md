# 1 Introduction

The focus of this assignment is similar to the previous one, as it involves unit testing using JUnit [3] in Eclipse [1]. Students will begin by getting familiar with the testing tools before proceeding with the implementation (enhancement) of the test suite. However, this assignment differs from the previous one (#2) in that it introduces students to a new technique for deciding which test cases to develop: white-box coverage criteria.
