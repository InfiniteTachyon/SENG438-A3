# 1 Introduction

The focus of this assignment is similar to the previous one, as it involves unit testing using JUnit in Eclipse. Students will begin by getting familiar with the testing tools before proceeding with the implementation (enhancement) of the test suite. However, this assignment differs from the previous Ass2 in that it introduces us to a new technique for deciding which test cases to develop: white-box coverage criteria.

In this lab, we will expan our unit test suite based on the previous lab. The test will also be developed based on white-box criteria, specifically in statement, branch and method coverage. This lab aim to create serveral more detailed test that fit in high percentage coverage criteria.

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.
1. Advantages of Requirements-based Test Generation: The first thing is focusing on the user's needs. It ensures that the software meets the requirements and helps create test cases that cover all functional requirements. Secondly, This approach provides traceability from the requirements to test cases, making it easy to track testing progress. Moreover, It will help the software by identifying and testing all the requirements thoroughly.
2. Advantages of Coverage-based Test Generation: It will ensure that all the code is executed during testing and provide quick results since it focuses on code coverage rather than requirements. Also, it can be easily scaled to large software systems.
3. Disadvantages of Requirements-based Test Generation: It only focuses on the functional requirements, which can lead to insufficient testing of non-functional requirements like performance and security. Also, it takes work to generate suitable test cases.
4. Disadvantages of Coverage-based Test Generation: It only tests the code written, but it may only test some of the functional requirements. The code coverage metrics do not necessarily indicate adequate software testing since it is possible to have high code coverage but still have defects in the software. Moreover, it requires maintenance since it needs to be updated whenever the code changes.

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the assignment
When we worked together, we realized that it could be challenging to coordinate schedules and ensure that everyone is working on the same page. Also, we found that Writing practical JUnit tests with a clear understanding of the codebase can be more accessible, which may lead to ineffective tests or false positives. On the other hand, we can overcome coordination issues by maintaining open communication channels and regularly checking in on each other's progress. Additionally, Writing practical JUnit tests is crucial for ensuring software quality and detecting defects early in the development process, and it helps us better understand this knowledge.
